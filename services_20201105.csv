Rationale:
Post-fire debris flows are particularly complex to study because they do not form discrete initiation locations and commonly involve multiple simultaneously operating erosional processes. Although recent work has begun to elucidate a more mechanistic understanding of post-fire debris flows, there is still a paucity of detailed sediment budgets characterizing these events. In this study, we seek to understand how post-fire sediment sources and erosional processes change over multiple storm cycles.

Methods: 
In addition to hydrologic data described and provided here, sediment budgets in this project were derived from SfM/lidar data (see UNAVCO repository here for metadata/data: https://www.unavco.org/data/lidar-sfm/lidar-sfm.html). 
 We installed two rain calibrated 0.2 mm tipping-bucket rain gages (Onset HOBO RG3-M), one located at a lower ridgeline (898 m elevation) and one located at the top of the watershed (1045 m elevation). The lower rain gage experienced a malfunction, but little difference in rainfall was found between gages for the storms with monitoring overlap, so we elected to use the continuous record of the upper-most gage. Soil volumetric water content sensors (Campbell Scientific CS616) were installed in depth profiles (5, 15, 30 cm) that were established on a north-facing shoulder slopes adjacent to the upper rain gage. In order to detect hillslope runoff production during storm events, we installed a ~ 50 cm diameter circular runoff plot following the design of Moody and Ebel (2012b) to identify storms that produced runoff near the upper drainage divide. We calculated 2-minute runoff values (Q2, mm hr-1) by dividing discharge (mm3/hr) from each bucket tip of a repurposed Onset HOBO RG3-M 0.2-mm tipping bucket rain gage by the bounded plot area (mm2). By converting to runoff values, we can facilitate the comparison of these values through a plot-scale runoff coefficient through the division of summed runoff by summed rainfall from the nearby tipping bucket gage. Finally, a Solinst Levelogger pressure transducer was installed further downslope in a hole drilled into bedrock channel (drainage area = 17 ha) to analyze the timing and peak pressure head (Hp) of sediment-laden flows as an integrated expression of watershed response (Kean et al., 2012). If significant rain was forecasted, the transducer was manually triggered to record at a 10-second frequency along with a barometric sensor (Solinst Barologger) tied to a tree adjacent to the channel in order to remove atmospheric pressure fluctuation from the pressure head time series.

The multi-disciplinary team of geoscientists working at the site are addressing a set of specific hypotheses that are related to the following overarching questions: How do critical zone processes and the flow and transformations of material differ in landscapes with contrasting bedrock but similar climates, land use, and geologic histories? What are the implications of these differences for the long term sustainability of water and soil resources? Research Overview Specifically, the observatory is quantifying and comparing critical zone (CZ) processes in landforms and watersheds underlain by three different rock types, granodiorites, volcaniclastics, and their associated contact metamorphic rocks. Previous research has demonstrated that these are some of the most rapidly eroding watersheds in the world. There are also dramatic, but poorly quantified, contrasts in CZ processes between areas underlain by these bedrocks. Individual research project include studies of deep weathering, soil formation and soil carbon accumulation, riparian zone dynamics, fluvial geomorphology, and meteorology. Infrastructure includes weather stations, instrumented soil pits and riparian zones, and stream flow gages. The principal researchers and students involve in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory are from the UPENN, the Pennsylvania State University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Puerto Rico, the US Geological Survey, and the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry.

Kick-started by a $35 million commitment by the William Penn Foundation, the Delaware River Watershed Initiative (DRWI) is targeting eight “clusters” within the basin for conservation investment. More than 50 leading nonprofits have joined together, aligning priorities for land protection and restoration projects and assessing water quality impacts using standardized methods.
 
Clusters were delineated using landscape variables including land use, conservation easements, and land trust areas in addition to input from local nonprofits. Monitoring sites in each cluster were chosen based on how representative of the cluster’s landscape they were. These sites represent the “typical” conditions of each cluster. The diversity of the landscape in each cluster influenced the number of sites, and they represent a range of watershed sizes (9-313 km2).
 
Monitoring for the DRWI began in 2013 and will continue through at least 2020. Chemical, algae, fish, and macroinvertebrate data are collected at each of the sites. Chemistry data are collected quarterly and the biotic community data are collected semiannually.  To capture potentially subtle changes over time in biotic communities, biological community sampling methods are quantitative, with identification to the lowest possible taxonomic level. These data are collected by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and Stroud Water Research Center.

The dataset includes rainfall data from twelve rain gauges distributed within the study area complemented by meteorological data of twelve official meteo-stations. It comprises discharge data derived from water stage measurements as well as suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) at six gauging stations of the Isábena river and its sub-catchments. Soil spectroscopic data from 351 suspended sediment samples and 152 soil samples were collected to characterize sediment source regions and sediment properties via fingerprinting analyses. The Isábena catchment (445 km²) is located in the Southern Central Pyrenees ranging from 450 m to 2,720 m in elevation, together with a pronounced topography this leads to distinct temperature and precipitation gradients. The Isábena river shows marked discharge variations and high sediment yields causing severe siltation problems in the downstream Barasona reservoir. Main sediment source are badland areas located on Eocene marls that are well connected to the river network. The dataset features a wide set of parameters in a high spatial and temporal resolution suitable for advanced process understanding of water and sediment fluxes, their origin and connectivity, sediment budgeting and for evaluating and further developing hydro-sedimentological models in Mediterranean meso-scale mountainous catchments.

Earth moving by humans associated with agriculture, urbanization, and excavation re-contours entire landscapes and constitutes a major geological force within the Critical Zone of planet Earth. The Critical Zone, defined as the terrestrial layer extending from tree tops through the groundwater and into stream networks, sustains most terrestrial life on the planet. At a greater rate than ever in Earth’s history, erosion and excavation expose sub-soil materials and unweathered minerals, which mix into and within soils and are transported as sediment loads through river networks, from headwaters to estuaries. To quantify the impacts on the global carbon cycle of humans as geological agents, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the University of Delaware (UD) and Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) will establish a Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) within the 1440 km2 Christina River drainage basin (CRB/CZO). Scientific investigations within the CRB/CZO, located in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Northern Delaware and straddling unglaciated Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, will test the following overarching hypothesis: Humans, by accelerating the introduction of minerals into biologically and chemically active zones, significantly enhance the interactions between minerals and organic matter and create globally significant impacts on the exchange of carbon between the land and the atmosphere. The human footprint within the CRB/CZO spans centuries, and current land uses include second-growth forests, agriculture, and suburban and urban development This provides an ideal natural laboratory in which we will investigate fundamental biological, chemical, and geological processes within the Critical Zone along a gradient of human impacts. We will particularly focus on the sources, transport and fates of water, sediments and carbon from uplands to inland waters and from inland waters to the coastal zone. The CRB/CZO will utilize cutting edge technologies for real-time gathering of hydrological, physical and chemical data and advances in cyber-infrastructure that seamlessly merge real-time data with state-of-the-art graphics tools to provide timely open access to quality controlled data and supporting materials. Field installations and data management advances will enhance an extensive existing network of stations used for monitoring water flow and water chemistry within the CRB basin, including Delaware Coastal Waters, and will build upon a solid foundation of decades of research conducted by UD, SWRC, and numerous state, federal, and non-governmental agencies. The CRB/CZO will serve as a resource to the greater scientific community through open access to data and opportunities for research projects that take advantage of the enhanced monitoring network. The new Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), located at UD, and Delaware's National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) will partner with the CRB/CZO on outreach activities. Public outreach to stakeholders within the Christina Basin is a critical step in making CRB/CZO data available to policy makers. Strong ties between UD and Delaware state agencies will enhance the sharing of environmental data and will provide outreach to the public and to policy makers. Some of our outreach will be coordinated through the Water Resources Agency, part of the UD Institute for Public Administration. The Christina Basin Water Quality Management Committee, which includes representatives from 15 federal, state, and local environmental resource agencies, hosts an annual series of public workshops to identify the science needs of policy makers. We will incorporate science results from the CRB/CZO into these workshops with the goal of providing a direct interface between science and public policy. The SWRC maintains 4 full-time staff members to translate our research into educational programs for middle- and high school-aged students, teachers, and citizen/conservation groups. Graduate students who are involved with the CRB/CZO will be advised by multidisciplinary team of scientists associated with the DENIN and with scientists at SWRC. Collaborations with other academic and federal agency personnel will further enhance interdisciplinary research, student education, and public outreach.","21081083",NA,"68","163","czo_udel","-75.79139","39.8548","39.94947","-75.65321"

consists of measuring devices and sensors, an equipment shelter for the radio telemetry equipment, and an antenna that 
also supports the solar panels used to keep batteries charged. A standard sensor configuration includes a snow pillow, 
a storage precipitation gage, and a temperature sensor. The snow pillow measures how much water is in the snowpack by 
weighing the snow with a pressure transducer. Devices in the shelter convert the weight of the snow into the snow's 
water equivalent -- that is, the actual amount of water in a given volume of snow. SNOTEL stations also collect data on 
snow depth, all-season precipitation accumulation, and air temperature with daily maximums, minimums, and averages. 
Many enhanced SNOTEL sites are equipped to take soil moisture and soil temperature measurements at various depths, 
as well as solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. The configuration at each site is tailored to the physical 
conditions, the climate, and the specific requirements of the data users.
The data collected at SNOTEL sites are generally reported multiple times per day, with some sensors reporting hourly","733421284",NA,"869","241","SNOTEL","-164.2926","32.92401","70.26666","-103.7876"

We are developing an interdisciplinary observatory in the southwestern US that will improve our fundamental understanding of the function, structure and co-evolution of biota, soils, and landforms that comprise the Critical Zone (CZ). The observatory is designed as a natural laboratory for the earth science community to test hypotheses related to CZ function in relation to climatic and water cycle variation. We posit that CZ systems organize and evolve in response to open system fluxes of energy and mass that can be quantified at point to watershed scales. These fluxes include meteoric CZ inputs of radiation, water, and carbon that are modulated by surficial biota to produce fluids and biogeochemical components that undergo biotic and abiotic transformation during gradient-driven transport. We hypothesize that the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is related specifically and predictably to the timing and magnitude of these fluxes. Therefore, our CZ Observatory (CZO) is designed to examine the impacts of space-time variability in energy and water flux on coupled CZ processes along two well-constrained climate gradients. The first is on rhyolitic parent material in the Jemez River Basin of northern New Mexico (JRB) and the second is on granite and schist bedrock within the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona (SCM). Measurement, modeling, and experimentation at sites that vary in parent rock, elevation, aspect, slope, soil development, and vegetation will enable quantification of the feedbacks between energy and mass fluxes (driven by chemical and physical gradients) and measured components of CZ structure. Our team has developed an iterative modeling and measurement strategy, and a management structure that fosters integration among disciplines. The JRB-SCM CZO is organized around broad questions that require an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach including the following two: How does variability in energy input and related mass flux influence CZ structure and function? How do feedbacks between landscape evolution and the cycling of water and carbon alter short- and long-term CZ development? To identify the couplings among physical, chemical, and biological processes, our research integrates four crosscutting science themes that are both multi-disciplinary and multi-scale: Ecohydrology and Hydrologic Partitioning, Subsurface Biogeochemistry, Landscape Evolution and Surface Water Dynamics. We are employing an integrated process-based modeling approach to (i) identify optimal sites for measuring structure and process, (ii) refine hypotheses developed through field-based observation and measurements, (iii) explore feedbacks and emergent system behaviors, and (iv) develop transfer functions that can be used to relate system behavior across scales and modes of observation. Discoveries made at the JRB-SCM CZO will improve our ability to predict CZ response to changes in climate and land cover, which is immediately useful to regional resource managers and will ultimately inform broader-scale decision making. We coordinate closely with other CZOs to support data collection, storage, and dissemination. Our education and outreach activities are built upon other highly effective educational efforts developed and led at UA. We are developing a range of products and activities for K-16 students, the general public, and stakeholders, including summer Observatory field experiences for local high school and undergraduate students, graduate courses, and field camps in earth science, as well as coordination of related efforts by other science centers active in the region.

What are the implications of these differences for the long term sustainability of water and soil resources? Research Overview Specifically, the observatory is quantifying and comparing critical zone (CZ) processes in landforms and watersheds underlain by three different rock types, granodiorites, volcaniclastics, and their associated contact metamorphic rocks. Previous research has demonstrated that these are some of the most rapidly eroding watersheds in the world. There are also dramatic, but poorly quantified, contrasts in CZ processes between areas underlain by these bedrocks.

By creating an interdisciplinary team working collaboratively in one observatory we aim to advance methods for characterizing regolith, to provide a theoretical basis for predicting the distribution and properties of regolith, and to theoretically and experimentally study the impacts of regolith on fluid pathways, flow rates, and residence times. The research site, the focus of National Science Foundation-supported research since the 1970s, has comprehensive datasets on distributed water budgets (1970-75), has served as a model test bed for hydrological response (1998-present), and will be augmented here by new geochemical, geomorphological, ecological, lidar, and soils datasets, all available to the research community. Shale Hills CZO represents an opportunity to investigate the rates and mechanisms of saprolite and soil formation on a relatively simple but ubiquitous bedrock lithology that has been documented to be important in determining global fluxes of C, P, and platinum–group elements worldwide. Furthermore, the regolith at Shale Hills has experienced at least two potentially significant perturbations in the geologically recent past: a climatic perturbation from periglacial to modern conditions, and a biologic perturbation from anthropogenic clearing of forests during and repeatedly since colonial occupation. The magnitude of these perturbations and their influence on regolith generation afford an opportunity to assess the time scales of response of soil production to both long-term climate change and human activity.","71037189",NA,"39","162","czo_psu","-77.90734","40.66375","40.66583","-77.90315"

","The GLEON_LakeAnnie Buoy was envisioned by Evelyn Gaiser (FIU) and Hilary Swain (Archbold Biological Station) in 2008, after Tim Kratz (Northern Lakes LTER) recommended Archbold add a buoy to complement the monthly lake data collection that started in 1983.  The buoy was an EMB-375 YSI buoy with a selection of sensors and instruments including a YSI sonde, thermistor chain, and LICOR PAR, as recommended by GLEON. With assistance of GLEON scientists the buoy was deployed in February 2008, in the center of the lake, together with a pressure gauge (water level) and rain gauge at the Lake Annie dock. New sensors have been added over time (micrometeorology). Many original and subsequent sensors have been replaced over time. The cost of the buoy, sensor replacement, and annual maintenance costs have been supported by Archbold Biological Station. The buoy has been maintained by Archbold technicians, especially Earl Keel, as well as Hilary Swain and Evelyn Gaiser. Datalogger programming and communications were completed by Earl Keel. Data collection began in February 2008 and the buoy has been deployed continuously since then, apart from an annual maintenance of ~2-3 days. There have been periods when different sensors failed and had to be replaced, resulting in several extended interruptions in data. Data are streamed via a wireless radio network every 15 minutes to the main buildings at Archbold, and real time data are available on the Archbold website (http://www.archbold-station.org/data/techview/index.html). Data QAQC includes systematic automated procedures (range, step, persistence) and intermittent manual review. Data are archived in an MS SQL database at Archbold for use within the GLEON network and beyond. During 2008-2015 there were 36 requests for Lake Annie buoy data and more than 11 publications (www.gleon.org).

This specific dataset consists of raw 15 minute data from the buoy, dock, and nearby weather station that have not been manually QC’ed.

We are developing an interdisciplinary observatory in the southwestern US that will improve our fundamental understanding of the function, structure and co-evolution of biota, soils, and landforms that comprise the Critical Zone (CZ). The observatory is designed as a natural laboratory for the earth science community to test hypotheses related to CZ function in relation to climatic and water cycle variation. We posit that CZ systems organize and evolve in response to open system fluxes of energy and mass that can be quantified at point to watershed scales. These fluxes include meteoric CZ inputs of radiation, water, and carbon that are modulated by surficial biota to produce fluids and biogeochemical components that undergo biotic and abiotic transformation during gradient-driven transport. We hypothesize that the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is related specifically and predictably to the timing and magnitude of these fluxes. Therefore, our CZ Observatory (CZO) is designed to examine the impacts of space-time variability in energy and water flux on coupled CZ processes along two well-constrained climate gradients. The first is on rhyolitic parent material in the Jemez River Basin of northern New Mexico (JRB) and the second is on granite and schist bedrock within the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona (SCM). Measurement, modeling, and experimentation at sites that vary in parent rock, elevation, aspect, slope, soil development, and vegetation will enable quantification of the feedbacks between energy and mass fluxes (driven by chemical and physical gradients) and measured components of CZ structure. Our team has developed an iterative modeling and measurement strategy, and a management structure that fosters integration among disciplines. The JRB-SCM CZO is organized around broad questions that require an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach including the following two: How does variability in energy input and related mass flux influence CZ structure and function? How do feedbacks between landscape evolution and the cycling of water and carbon alter short- and long-term CZ development? To identify the couplings among physical, chemical, and biological processes, our research integrates four crosscutting science themes that are both multi-disciplinary and multi-scale: Ecohydrology and Hydrologic Partitioning, Subsurface Biogeochemistry, Landscape Evolution and Surface Water Dynamics. We are employing an integrated process-based modeling approach to (i) identify optimal sites for measuring structure and process, (ii) refine hypotheses developed through field-based observation and measurements, (iii) explore feedbacks and emergent system behaviors, and (iv) develop transfer functions that can be used to relate system behavior across scales and modes of observation. Discoveries made at the JRB-SCM CZO will improve our ability to predict CZ response to changes in climate and land cover, which is immediately useful to regional resource managers and will ultimately inform broader-scale decision making. We coordinate closely with other CZOs to support data collection, storage, and dissemination. Our education and outreach activities are built upon other highly effective educational efforts developed and led at UA. We are developing a range of products and activities for K-16 students, the general public, and stakeholders, including summer Observatory field experiences for local high school and undergraduate students, graduate courses, and field camps in earth science, as well as coordination of related efforts by other science centers active in the region. We invite new investigators throughout the global earth sciences community to conduct novel and collaborative research at the JRB-SCM CZO.","6748694",NA,"25","177","czo_catalina","-110.8405","32.4261","32.55995","-110.7399"

Scientists from the Woods Hole Research Center and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have joined with partners from around the world to investigate river chemistry in Earth’s most significant river systems. Now active in 18 watersheds around the world – with the goal of expanding to several more – the Global Rivers Observatory is measuring the chemical composition of rivers near their mouths where they empty into the ocean.
	
The Global Rivers Observatory is advancing understanding of how climate change, deforestation, and other disturbances are impacting river chemistry and land-ocean linkages. This knowledge is vital for tracking the health of Earth’s watersheds and for predicting how Earth’s water and chemical cycles will change in the future. As the human population approaches 9 billion people over the coming decades, this understanding will be essential as vast numbers of people that are dependent on the services rivers provide struggle to adapt to rapidly changing conditions.","7033",NA,"37","3534","GlobalRiversObservatory","-124.3768","49.10447","54.42168","-118.6027"
